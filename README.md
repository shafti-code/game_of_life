### very basic dumb and in all things considered sub-optimal implementation of Conway's game of life
run with 
```bash
make
```
### brand new commands

```
-r\treseed the simulation if it gets stale
-s\tseed the board randomly
```

### technologies used
- c lang
- gcc
- gnumake
- ncurses
- c standard lib

### roadmap/featurelist
- [x] drawing initial state with the mouse
- [x] simulation
- [ ] quick guide on the first frame (all the keys written out and some info about the program)
- [ ] loading and saving boardstates from/to files

### unimportant info
supplied main executable file is compiled for arm64 platforms
